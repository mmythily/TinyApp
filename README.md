#Project Description

Tiny URL is a tool to shorten long URLs. This web app uses Node and Express to build a simple web server and practise using http routes

##Goal
This four-day project helped build a web app using Node. The app will allow users to shorten long URLs much like TinyURL.com and bit.ly do.

I built a HTTP Server that handles requests from the browser for the user. I learned to use Express, a web framework that uses handlers for HTTP requests.
